# DojoManager

A management suite for a typical martial arts school's day to day operations. This includes updating students about events, managing payments, curriculum information, and event planning.

Students will have a dashboard where their personal information is available, including testing dates, upcoming events, schedule changes, and payment history.

Instructors will be able to add and manage students and their contact details, plan lessons, and record payments and membership status.
